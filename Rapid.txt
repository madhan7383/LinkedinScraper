Over our long history, we have invested in more than 100 companies across a wide range of niche consumer, commercial, distribution, manufacturing, and service markets throughout the United States. CFB provides all levels of junior capital to great companies with highly capable management teams and strong growth prospects. Our goal is long-term growth and the creation of value.
